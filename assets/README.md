# Assets

Essential static assets (logos, icons, downloadable collateral) should live in this directory. Keep the set minimal and ensure all filenames are referenced using `/assets/<name>` paths within the frontend.

> ℹ️  Large media and generated content should be stored in object storage (e.g. Cloud Storage or S3) rather than the repository.
