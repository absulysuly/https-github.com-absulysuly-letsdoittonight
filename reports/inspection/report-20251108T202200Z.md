# Hamlet Unified Inspection Report — 2025-11-08T20:22Z

## ✅ Build & Tooling Updates
- Migrated Tailwind from CDN to the local PostCSS pipeline using `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`; global styles moved into `index.css` and imported through the Vite entry (`index.tsx`).
- Added missing production environment configuration (`.env.production`) with `VITE_API_BASE_URL` pointing to the deployed Railway backend.
- Converted Vite entry point to the modern React 19 runtime (`StrictMode` + `createRoot`) to eliminate duplicate default React registrations.
- Removed the redundant default React import from `components/TopNavBar.tsx`, resolving the "React has already been declared" build failure.

## ✅ Backend Connectivity & CORS
- Attempted to reach `https://hamlet-unified-complete-2027-production.up.railway.app/health`; the corporate HTTP proxy returned `403 Forbidden` while negotiating the CONNECT tunnel, so the endpoint itself could not be validated from this environment. Recommend re-testing from an unrestricted network before release.
- No backend CORS handler exists in this repository (frontend-only). Backend adjustments would need to be applied directly to the Railway service if cross-origin issues persist in production.

## ✅ Waveform Visualization
- Waveform utility already falls back to a generated placeholder and logs network/CORS failures; confirmed that `AudioPlayer` consumes the fallback path gracefully when waveform decoding fails, so no runtime crash occurs.

## ⚙️ Outstanding Warnings / Follow-Up
- `npm install` and `npm run build` currently fail inside this workspace because the proxy blocks downloading packages such as `tailwindcss`. Once network access is restored, rerun `npm install` and `npm run build` to verify the migration.
- Production smoke-tests (`vercel --prod --yes`, frontend health checks) were not executed because Vercel CLI is unavailable and outbound access to the backend is blocked.

## Files Updated
- `.env.production`
- `index.html`
- `index.tsx`
- `index.css`
- `components/TopNavBar.tsx`
- `package.json`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Retry `npm install` and `npm run build` once proxy restrictions are lifted to confirm the Tailwind migration.
2. From a network without proxy limitations, verify the Railway `/health` and `/api/candidates` endpoints and redeploy backend CORS changes if necessary.
3. After a successful build, redeploy the frontend to Vercel and smoke-test waveform rendering with live audio assets.
